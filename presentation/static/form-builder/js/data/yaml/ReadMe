Step 1) In the js/data/yaml folder are yaml files each, of which corresponds to a tab in the form builder.
Step 2) If you just want to add a new element you need to: describe it in one of these files parse the yaml to json
	using parse.rb in the same folder create a corresponding template in the templates/snippet directory
	add the template to snippet-templates.js
Step 3) If you want to add a new tab, you'll also need to adjust the app.js file to make sure the tab is loaded.
